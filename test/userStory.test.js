/*

User story:
As a user, I want to be able to view my own profile data because I want to customize my online account for interactions with other users.

What CRUD do we need here? - Direct work with the database
Read for viewing data
Update for customizing data

Authorization - act as users to edit the database
User can edit only their own data
User can not edit other user's data
Admin can edit any user's data


Seed file needs to make:
- At least 2 users (one to act in the test, one to be edited upon)
- At least 1 admin
- A bunch of valid profile data for any update tests
- A bunch of invalid profile data for any update tests
